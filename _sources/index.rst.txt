Quick Setup
===========
Hi, this will be a quick tutorial for how to setup the simulation

Downloading and installing the simulation
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/ikoursh/EcoSystemProject
	cd EcoSystemProject/proj
	pip -r requirements.txt

If you want to add support for animation you will need an installation of ffmpeg. To do so you can go `here <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`_ (don't forget to add it to PATH, `this <https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/>`_ is a great explanation)
 Note that pip install ffmpeg does not seem to work, however, linux users may use apt.

Done!
You can now import the module from python or use the included auto.py file

.. Hint:: It's always a good idea to setup a virtual environment

auto.py
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 auto.py -s 100000

You can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 auto.py -h

To get more information

Importing the model directly
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

	from model2 import Sim
	my_sim = Sim()
	my_sim.run(max_attempts=3)

.. SeeAlso:: :meth:`model2.Sim.run` :class:`model2.Sim`



More advanced users
-------------------

For users who desire more control, see the :ref:`Global Paramaters` section.
Additionally, it is possible to manually call the :meth:`model2.Sim.step` function directly for more precise control.
See the source code for more information.


The Simulation
==============

Global Parameters
-----------------

.. _Global Parameters:

The simulation makes use of a config.ini file that keeps track of the global parameters.
These are the global constants that define the simulation

*	**INT_CONST** = 1 - Energy cost for intelligence (IQ, EQ average)
*	**ENLB_CONST** = 0.5 - energy to mass ratio used to determine if an agent is sick if so the agent starts to lose health
*	**ENGB_CONST** = 0.5 – energy to mass ratio used to determine if an agent is healthy, used to gain health and to gain mass if the agent is still growing
*	**ENL_CONST** = 1 - the amount of health lost if an agent’s energy is under the threshold.
*	**ENG_CONST** = 4 - the amount of energy gained if an agent is above the energy threshold
*	**MAX_LIFE_SPAN** = 200 - the maximum amount of steps an agent with mass 100 can survive after reaching maturity
*	**AGE_CONST** = ENG_CONST - (100 / MAX_LIFE_SPAN) - Age suffered every step, derived from the maximum life span and the amount of health an agent can gain per turn.
*	**POP_DENCITY** = 1 - controls how concentrated is the populous (map scaled size)
*	**AGING_TIME** = 0.99 - the mass percentage required before maturity (age starts)
*	**G_SPEED_FACTOR** = 1 - controls universal speed, provides a way to control gravity and friction
*	**FOOD_CONST** = 25 - how much energy a food item contains
*	**START_MASS_P** = 0.95 – The mass to final mass ratio for the initial population
*	**G_FOOD_COL_CONST** = 0.1 - the global accuracy for food collisions (actual is scaled)
*	**G_FIGHT_COL_CONST** = 0.1 - the global accuracy for fight collisions (actual is scaled)
*	**MIN_IQ** = 1 - the minimum number of hidden neurons (per layer).
*	**MAX_IQ** = 10 – the maximum number of hidden neurons (per layer)
*	**MIN_EQ** = 1– the minimum number of hidden neurons (per layer)
*	**MAX_EQ** = 10 - the maximum number of hidden neurons (per layer)
*	**FOOD_FLUCT** = 1 - 0.3 – the percentage food is allowed to dip before it is reproduced.
*	**GROUP_FACTOR** = 100 - A factor applied to the collision constant to define the minimum distance between 2 agents that are in the same group

.. Note:: these values may not be always up to date with the current config. Check `here <https://github.com/ikoursh/EcosystemProject/blob/master/proj/config.ini>`_ for the most up to date values, or your own config.ini(located at proj/config.ini) for your specific values.
